Sequence of steps to start Autonomous mode

How does single pneumatic piston have 3 stops? Hall Effect sensor can detect when the piston is fully extended, but not halfway (according to Steve).



Start at a roughly determined position on the field
Robot must locate target(s) and adjust position to lock in on intended target



Trigger Autonomous Mode - from driver station
	PARALELL TASKS:
	Start Blinky Lights
	Confirm pneumatic pressure at correct level
	
	Unfold shooter - pneumatics (1)
	
	Confirm pneumatic pressure at correct level
	
	PARALELL TASKS:
	Position shooter - pneumatics (2)
	Do something with under-light??
	
	PARALELL TASKS:
	Position robot to target
	shooter motor spins up to speed - Sensor
	Do something with under-light??
	
	PARALELL TASKS:
	verify robot on target
	Do something with under-light??
	
	Loop through 3 frisbees:
		Confirm pneumatic pressure at correct level
		Feed frisbee - pneumatics (3)

		Verify shooter motor back to speed - Sensor

		Verify still on target
		Do something with under-light???
	
	Do something with under-light?
	

Need to consider alternate approaches; the above assumes we are positioned in the cen ter back of the pyramid
